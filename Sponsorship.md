# hapi.js Sponsorship Guidelines

The hapi.js community consists of multiple modules, each with its own lead maintainer. The effort
required to maintain a module can vary from a casual task a few hours a month to a time consuming
effort which requires daily activity. This document describes the ways in which lead maintainers
may obtain sponsorship for their effort or give proper credit to an employer supporting them.

This policy is not a binding document but a list of best practices that if followed, will provide
a consistent and fair handling of sponsorships across the hapi.js ecosystem.

In most cases, a sponsorship recognizes the company employing the lead maintainer. However, lead
maintainers may grant sponsorship spots to any company or organization they choose, and may do so
in exchange for goods, services, or payment. If sponsorships are made available to entities other
than the lead maintainer's employer, it should be done fairly and on an equal opportunity basis.

A sponsorship package should include the following:
* The sponsor name and logo with a short description and link on the module main README.md file.
    * The logo should appear at the top of the document so it is visible on the module GitHub and
      npm pages without scrolling.
    * The company logo image size should not exceed 500x200px.
    * The sponsorship section should be properly identified with "This module is sponsored by".
* The sponsor name and logo listed on the hapi.js website under http://hapijs.com/sponsors.
    * The page should include two sections, active sponsors at the top and alumni sponsors at the
      bottom.
    * No company should be listed more than once within each section.
    * Each listing should mention the module or modules it is sponsoring.
* A monthly tweet or retweet about the sponsorship on the @hapijs Twitter account.

Module Sponsorships should be limited to:
* Each module should only have one sponsor at a time.
* A module should not have more than one sponsor a month on average.
